## Acoustic Atlas  
*14 October 2021*


**Acoustic Atlas** is an online platform dedicated to the exploration of *space through sound*. It presents a growing collection of virtual acoustic environments derived from real-world locations — including heritage sites, architectural spaces, and imagined or reconstructed environments — allowing listeners to experience place through listening rather than sight.

The project combines **field recording**, **impulse response measurement**, **auralisation**, and **spatial audio techniques** to create immersive listening experiences that sit at the intersection of art, research, and cultural heritage. Acoustic Atlas is used both as a creative tool for composers and artists, and as a research and educational resource for understanding how sound behaves in space.
