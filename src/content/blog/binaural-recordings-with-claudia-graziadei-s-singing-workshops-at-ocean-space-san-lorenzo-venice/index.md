Singer and artist **Claudia Graziadei** led a series of remarkable singing workshops at **Ocean Space**, San Lorenzo, Venice. I captured the rich blend of voice, breath, and architectural space — characterised by massive reverberation — using a **dummy-head microphone** created by **Riccardo Farnea**, fitted with my **binaural DPA 4060 microphones**.

The recordings reveal how collective vocal practice activates the acoustics of a heritage space, transforming it into a shared resonant body. Subtle movements of breath, shifts in vocal focus, and the natural decay of sound within the architecture create a liminal sonic environment — one that exists between meditation, listening, and communal presence.

These binaural recordings aim to preserve not only the sound of the workshops, but also their spatial and relational qualities: voice as vibration, architecture as instrument, and listening as a form of embodied connection.
