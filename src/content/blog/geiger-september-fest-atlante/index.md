For several years, GEIGER have discussed with Berlin-based artist, researcher, and label manager Cedrik Fermont about collaborating on some of his projects. Following more than two decades of research in alternative electronic, experimental, and noise music in and from Asia and Africa, he recently published some compilations dedicated to this topic and several essays about electroacoustic, noise, and experimental music on these continents. With the release of the compilation CD ”Alternate African Reality – Electronic, electro acoustic and experimental from Africa and the diaspora” in 2020, we invited Cedrik to curate this festival together with us, with this CD as a starting point. The history of electronic and experimental music in Africa roughly started in the 1950s (with the notable exception of Halim El-Dabh in 1944) and today this music landscape is a rich and various one.

Alternate Africa.

A new reality or better say another reality, another view on Africa, far from the usual clichés, Alternate Africa aims to challenge how the world perceives music in and from Africa and its varied diaspora and cultures.

This is neither Afrofuturism, nor the future of music, this is not some kind of exceptional music from Africa, this is one of the many current realities: music from Africa and its diaspora is not stuck into traditional memes, it’s vibrant, innovative and travels as fast as the speed of light, like everywhere else, but with one notable difference: its lack of representation outside of the continent.

Electronic, electroacoustic, free improvised music do not belong to a geographic place (anymore?), rather they belong to an era. Our contemporary era is hyper connected and the past two decades have seen the music world embracing the digital age. If there is a new geography, we will find it inside this new world, as imperfect as it is, as elitist it still can be, rhizomatic networks are under permanent constructions.

We find artists who embrace full digital technology, others whose music archives blend languages, culture, ancient and modern technology, cut-up techniques meeting turntablism or journalistic adventures, cinematic electroacoustic music meets free improvisation. We all use similar technologies and add our own cultural imprints that rather than creating larger gaps, bring colourful ideas and feedback of cultural exchanges.

These networks spread their arms in every direction, once and for all, we wish this to be an experience shared by everyone and not a one way street; we build bridges, not cabinets of curiosities!

Electroacoustic, experimental and other forms of electronic music are not new on the continent: from Halib El-Dab’s (proto) musique concrete experiments in 1944 in Egypt, to June Schneider’s multimedia installations in the 1970s’ South Africa and today’s young composers all over the continent, there is a whole world of sounds that has been put aside for too long and we hope this small introduction will engage the listeners and the players into deeper conversations and collaborations.

Cedrik Fermont, festival co-producer

Duma (KE)

In 2019 Martin Kanja (aka Lord Spike Heart) (vocals) and Sam Karugu (guitarist, producer), both emerging from Nairobi’s underground metal scene, formed Duma. Their debut album fuses hardcore punk and thrash metal with noise, taking the African metal scene into new, experimental territories. The lyrics depict the band’s everyday life: love, hate, drugs, being young and broke. But there are also songs such as Pembe 666, which includes passages from the Book of Revelation in Swahili.

FRKTL (EG)

FRKTL is the solo project of British- Egyptian interdisciplinary artist Sarah Badr, now based in Riga. A classically trained multi-instrumentalist, she incorporates live sampling and improvisation, vocal manipulation, field recordings and generative rhythms to compose immersive sound explorations. Most recently, visual sound spatialisation technologies allow her to examine the relation between form and place in digital spaces. Over the past decade, Badr’s artistic practise has expounded on mixed reality and world creation through CGI, augmented scene capture, and sound design.

Cobi van Tonder (ZA)

Cobi van Tonder was born in South Africa and worked as a musician in Johannesburg with bands (e.g. Nothing and Otoplasma) in the late 1990s and early 2000s. She explores diverse avenues of listening as art-making space that she describes as ‘expanded listening’. Some of her pieces revolve around microtonal drone music, exploring aspects such as beating patterns and sonic illusions. She also explores acoustics as a prominent musical parameter which has led to her project ACOUSTIC ATLAS. Here, a space (or interior) becomes another ‘instrument’ with unique properties of echo and resonance.

Robert Machiri/Pungwee listening (ZW)

Robert Machiri is a sound worker born in Harare. Previously based in Johannesburg he currently resides in Berlin. He is a hoarder of things and ideas inspired by a biographical recollection of music; an embodied source for sonic study and memory. His work exists at the interstice of two streams of practice; his curatorial concepts and art which are presented through embodied critique as learning-through-unlearning, interwoven by sound, music and image-making. His most notable project PUNGWE is an interdisciplinary project circling sound in Africa with related contemporary arts discourses and spaces.
