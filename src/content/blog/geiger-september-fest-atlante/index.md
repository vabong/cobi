## Geiger September Fest – Atlante  
*9 April 2022*

For several years, **GEIGER** had been in conversation with Berlin-based artist, researcher, and label manager **Cedrik Fermont** about collaborating on one of his projects. Following more than two decades of research into alternative electronic, experimental, and noise music in and from **Asia and Africa**, Cedrik has published several compilations and essays dedicated to these fields.

With the release of the compilation CD *Alternate African Reality – Electronic, electroacoustic and experimental music from Africa and the diaspora* in 2020, GEIGER invited Cedrik to curate this festival together with them, using the CD as a conceptual starting point. The history of electronic and experimental music in Africa began roughly in the 1950s (with the notable exception of **Halim El-Dabh in 1944**), and today this musical landscape is rich, diverse, and evolving.

## Alternate Africa

A new reality — or perhaps better, *another* reality. **Alternate Africa** seeks to challenge how music in and from Africa and its varied diaspora is perceived, moving far beyond familiar clichés.

This is neither Afrofuturism nor a speculative future of music. It is not an exceptional or exotic outlier. Rather, it represents one of many present realities: music from Africa and its diaspora is vibrant, innovative, and travels as fast as anywhere else in the world — with one crucial difference: its persistent lack of representation outside the continent.

Electronic, electroacoustic, and free improvised music no longer belong to specific geographic places; instead, they belong to an era. Our contemporary world is hyper-connected, and over the past two decades the music ecosystem has deeply embraced digital culture. If a new geography exists, it is embedded within this networked world — imperfect, sometimes elitist, yet continuously reshaped through rhizomatic connections.

Some artists fully embrace digital technologies, while others work with archives blending language, culture, ancient and modern tools. Cut-up techniques meet turntablism; journalistic exploration merges with cinematic electroacoustic composition; free improvisation intersects with sound art. Shared technologies become sites of cultural exchange rather than division.

These networks extend in all directions. The goal is an experience shared collectively — not a one-way gaze. **We build bridges, not cabinets of curiosities.**

Electroacoustic, experimental, and electronic music have long histories on the African continent: from Halim El-Dabh’s proto–musique concrète experiments in 1944 Egypt, to June Schneider’s multimedia installations in 1970s South Africa, to today’s young composers across the continent. A vast sonic world has been sidelined for too long. This festival hopes to invite deeper conversations, listening, and collaboration.

## Artists

### Duma (KE)
Formed in 2019 by **Martin Kanja (Lord Spike Heart)** (vocals) and **Sam Karugu** (guitar, production), Duma emerged from Nairobi’s underground metal scene. Their debut album fuses hardcore punk and thrash metal with noise, pushing African metal into experimental territory. Lyrics explore everyday life — love, hate, drugs, precarity — alongside apocalyptic imagery such as *Pembe 666*, which incorporates passages from the Book of Revelation in Swahili.

Born in South Africa, **Cobi van Tonder** worked in Johannesburg’s music scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
