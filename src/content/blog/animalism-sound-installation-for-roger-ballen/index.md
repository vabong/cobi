This was the second sound installation created in conversation with — and in parallel to — a **Roger Ballen** exhibition.

Roger Ballen (born in New York in 1950, resident in South Africa for over forty years) is one of the most influential contemporary photographers. With *Animalism*, a research project he has pursued for over two decades, Ballen explores the profound and often disturbing relationship between humans and animals.

The images on display blur the boundaries between human and animal behaviour, questioning the very nature of this distinction. Designed for the exhibition space of the **Mattatoio di Roma** — a former slaughterhouse where animals were once killed for human consumption — the exhibition unfolds as a single installation: a distinctly *ballenesque* theatre in which primal instincts and absurdity dominate. The Mattatoio itself, a site marked by historical violence and human domination over animals, becomes part of the work, reimagined as a space for reflection.

Through surreal compositions and dark absurdity, *Animalism* reveals the animal as both an external presence and an intrinsic element of the human psyche, exposing deep connections between civilisation and wild nature.

For **River of Souls**, I focused on intimate, close-up sounds
