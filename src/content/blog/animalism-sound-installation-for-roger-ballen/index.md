River of Souls - Sound installation for ANIMALISM – **May 27 - July 27, 2025**

  

Curated by Alessandro Dandini de Sylva

In collaboration with Marguerite Rossouw

Sound installation by Cobi van Tonder. Exhibition promoted by the Department of Culture of Rome Capitale and the Palaexpo Special Company. Organized by the Palaexpo Special Company in collaboration with ISTMO.  

  

This was the second sound installation in conversation/parallel/as soundtrack to a Roger Ballen show.

  

Roger Ballen (born in New York in 1950, has lived in South Africa for over forty years) is one of the greatest and best-known contemporary photographers. With _Animalism_ , a research he has been pursuing for over two decades, he explores the profound and often disturbing relationship between humans and animals.

The images on display blur the lines between human and animal behavior, questioning the very nature of this distinction. Designed for the exhibition space of the Mattatoio di Roma—a former slaughterhouse where animals were once killed for human consumption—the exhibition is conceived as a single installation: a typically "ballenesque" theater, where the absurd and primal instincts reign supreme. The Mattatoio itself, a symbol of historical violence and human domination over animals, becomes part of the work, reinvented as a space for reflection.

Through surreal compositions and dark absurdity, _Animalism_ reveals how the animal is both an external presence and an intrinsic part of the human psyche, uncovering the profound connections between civilization and wild nature.

  

For river of souls, I focused on the more subtle close-up sounds of animals - the 30min loop starts with the sounds of hundreds of animal feet walking from the entrance to the back of the Mattatoio - recording of their feet, breath, pan across the space, to create feeling of bodies flowing through the space, quiestly passing like a river of souls. Mixed with their hearbeats. After they pass, doves and other birds fly through the space, mixed with various abstract sounds and deep bass drone tones. The piece then slowly transforms through various nature soundscapes, one is that of a surround recording in a forrest, with the creaking of tree barks, wind, drops, birds, insects, animals small and big.

  

When it comes to the idea of 'darkness' - I've always been very attracted to it - people often say my sounds are 'scary' but to me they are beautiful depth - the abyss - the vastness of existence - the place of dreams - the space of the soul - dark matter turns out to be the larger part of our universe - a matter not understood by science - but to me something that can be expressed in sound, drone, beating patterns, making bass tones that have massive wavelengths.  So I try to create space by contrasting super close 'surface' sounds - like a bee flying past the microphone, or the hyper realistic bird wings flying in 3d realism through the space, sounds of touch, interior sounds of the blood and heart, and then contrast it with the bass and the vast reverberant space that can be created from feeding sounds into the virtual Taj Mahal reverb, large cathedrals, spaces that are airy and watery.

  

Because of the existing reverb in the Mattatioa, I had to minimal with the drone elements and it is a challenge to create that super close-up contrasts, because every sound will mix with the Mattaoia acoustics.
