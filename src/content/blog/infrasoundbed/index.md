*Lullaby for InfrasoundBed (40min loop) – Toffee Festival, City Hall, Cape Town.*

Using a 1000 Watt amplified bass shaker, this work is based on frequencies of the planets in counterpart with an infra sound channel that sweeps through the body, pulsing frequency sweeps into physical vibrations all the way down to 5Hz.

Beyond the completely visceral vibration and shaking of the bed through the body, musical counterpoint between frequencies heard in headphones and frequencies felt through the body is the main musical framework.

Created for Toffee Festival, City Hall, Cape Town, 2011.
