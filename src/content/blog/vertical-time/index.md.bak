Premiere for VERTICAL TIME – Cobi van Tonder 16 August 2025

I was commissioned by the Transforming Data Reuse in Archaeology (TETRARCHs) project, by the lead partner from the Department of Archaeology at the University of York, to create the piece which you will hear this evening. TETRARCHs explores ways in which archaeologists collect data and use that data for storytelling in ways that are meaningful for diverse audiences. (It is funded by the Collaboration of Humanities and Social Sciences in Europe CHANSE, which is a joint initiative of 27 research funding organizations from 24 countries, under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.)

Through the Dept of Archaeology York, in collaboration with the University of Durham, and Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism, I was introduced to a project that investigates Bronze Age domestic life at Hili Archaeological Park in Al Ain, UAE—a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The focus is on the Hafit and Umm an-Nar periods (c. 3200–2000 BCE), and address longstanding gaps in knowledge about everyday life, domestic architecture, and socio-economic organization in the region. Initial excavations in 2022/3 successfully identified preserved archaeological deposits and features, including mudbrick structures, irrigation systems, and activity areas suggesting cooking and craft production. During their most recent season (2023/4) I observed them analyzing materials from previous and recent excavations,

conducting targeted excavations using aerial and terrestrial surveys.

Broadly, the Bronze Age in Al Ain began around 3000 BCE, with evidence of agricultural villages emerging. A century or two later, between 2500 and 2000 BCE, Hili’s settlement and monumental tomb construction expanded significantly during the peak of the Umm an-Nar era. Hili 16 and its associated tombs and structures date firmly to the Umm anNar phase (c. 2700–2000 BCE), making them approximately 4,200–4,700 years old.

I attended excavations, participated in project meetings and interviewed archaeologists on site. I also made some field recordings of the surrounding area, of the sounds of archeology itself (mostly digging, tapping, brushing and scratching sounds) and I also recorded the impulse response or echoes of a Falaj water system and some Hafit tombs - small, bee-hive-shaped stone structures that represent the earliest Bronze Age burial tradition in southeastern Arabia, marking the beginning of more permanent and ceremonial treatment of the dead. These tombs were often used by mobile pastoralist communities, and their construction signaled a shift toward territorial anchoring and social memory. (Later, during the Umm an-Nar period (c. 2800–2000 BCE), the burial practices changed: tombs became larger, circular, and collective, like those at Hili and Umm an-Nar Island — often reused for generations).

Talking to the archaeology team, I learned about how archaeologists go about documenting the process of excavation, since it is a ‘destructive process’ as they dig deeper, they destroy the layers that’s been before and thus they need to carefully document this. One such process is termed a Harris matrix, and I was very impressed by this system and its possible application to become a musical score of some sort. I observed the intuition the experienced archaeologists develop to distinguish between subtle layers of dust and earth to excavate what was previously a wall of a room or a fireplace. Using sound cues through tapping on surfaces to navigate and reveal a structure buried in ~5000 years. Especially this type of site, where the bricks of walls were made from the very same material as that of the sand that buried it in time, and where on top of the bronze age settlement iron age settlements were developed, the nuances are incredibly delicate and a novice like me, was amazed at observing the archaeologist decipher the cues. During some conversations the part that struck me very deeply was the idea that digging one millimeter could mean digging through a year or in some cases many years of time – of course it’s not evenly spread out like that, in a space very little activity happened, it could be different - the rate of sediment accumulation or site formation depends on many factors—climate, human activity, erosion, and natural events like floods or sandstorms. 1 mm of stratified cultural deposit could represent anywhere from a few years (if actively used) to a century (in quiet or abandoned periods). If occupation

lasted about 1000 years, then 1m of vertical digging could reveal 1000 years!

Thus, the title for the piece formed: time layered and buried vertically in the soil – relating to the microtonal drone music I developed during my PhD compositional research – which was a shift in musical thinking from horizontal rhythmic and melodic musical motives to a kind of ‘frozen’ dronelike, minimalist wash of vertical frequency layers, suspended in space. Music that slowly transforms and reveals its internal qualities and micro pulses in time, more like a sunset, like the sky changing subtly than a dramatic musical progression. My personal attraction to this being a search for a kind of silence, like jumping into water, being submerged in an alternate reality. Standing there in Hili16, observing the careful digging and gentle brushing of dust, blowing in the wind, against the dramatic light of the sunrise, this piece was born, with a feeling of time, many- thousand-year-old ghosts, the impossibility of reaching them, except through DNA that may now be in the people of this area, contemplating a 5000 year time window, next jumping in my mind to 5000 years from now – will some AI humanoids be digging out our remains? Will someone be wondering about us?

Vertical Time is above all for me about this, memories and consciousness buried, layer by layer, in the soil with the feeling of our human fragility and human hope and continuous survival juxtaposed against the vertical depth of time. Time, often represented horizontally on classical music scores or on timelines and calendars – in the west often a line flowing from left to right. In stark contrast, this is time buried vertically, in millimeters.

The poetry of archaeology lies in this. The now, on the surface, the past underground, the future waiting in the heavens. Time also as mathematics and specifically as sound: frequency is calculated as cycles per second. The higher a tone, the more cycles per second. The lower, the bigger the wavelength, with a 3000m wavelength roughly being 10 second for a single cycle to complete. So I start to work in abstract

frequencies imagining their wavelengths and map out a kind of desert and dunes of sound to reach a feeling of vastness: Al Ain is surrounded by the desert, endless dunes that are in themselves living slow shapeshifting monuments of time. They visually represent giant godlike waves that move over extreme slow time.

The Rubʿ alKhālī—also known as the Empty Quarter—is the largest continuous sand sea in the world, covering about 650,000 km² across Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, and Yemen. Its dunes can soar up to ~250–300 m in height and rest upon landscapes that were once hardened lake beds and salt flats from up to 6,000 years ago. Within Rubʿ alKhālī, several named dunefields include the Liwa dunes near Abu Dhabi (now often referred to as the Liwa "singing sands"), and Liwa’s Umm AlSamim margins with shifting crescent. I would have loved to record them myself, but for now I resort to finding online recordings of these dunes that likely formed over thousands of years, oe more. Several crescent-shaped dunes in the region (such as near Mesaieed in Qatar just north of the Empty Quarter) are known to “sing”—producing booming or humming tones in a range of 80hz-120, and some research and recordings between 90 and 105 Hz, with some harmonics at ~450 Hz) when sand avalanches or wind-triggered slides occur. It is also possible to ‘rub’ the surface to produce these bass tones.

Vertical Time starts in the desert, with the dunes, with the deep singing bass tones, (as well as synthesized dunes), contrasted against desert wind field recordings, that morphs through various vantage points such as the echo of the tombs and falaj tunnels. Next, slowly in vertical time, layers of abstract frequency clusters are presented – some pitches so high, their wavelengths are as tiny as sand grains, they sting the ears like needles, others manifest as low bass tones. They are created via the phenomenon of difference tone pulsing, ranging from extremely deep tones to extremely high tones – they form pulsing interference patterns. The audience is invited to move around and/or turn their heads to experience the physicality of the sound in the air.

Difference tone pulsing is a fascinating acoustic phenomenon where two slightly different frequencies are played together, producing a third, lower "ghost" tone equal to the difference between them—so if 400 Hz and 410 Hz are sounded, the listener perceives a pulsing 10 Hz tone. This effect can create deep, rhythmic sensations felt throughout the body, especially when used with low-frequency or infrasound tones that travel in powerful waves capable of resonating within large spaces—or even the body itself. In bioresonance practices, this concept is mirrored in ancient traditions like Ayurveda, which describes sound (nāda) as a primal force influencing the chakras; Tibetan singing bowls and Zen bells use harmonic overtones to create entrainment and meditative states; and in Chinese medicine and qigong, specific tones correspond to organ systems and meridians. It is the audio-physical experience of sound as vibration. I choose and play around with clusters of frequencies, based on how they make me feel, how they sound and what they represent.

Vertical Time—into the sand, into memory, into the underlayers of human consciousness.

Time fell downward, like sediment.

_The premiere was a wonderful summer night performance in the garden of the Malacusa House in Fantese, Puglia. With multi-channel surround loudspeakers, I started with the sound of wind in the vast desert, then fading in the singing dunes - deep vibrations around 110 Hz. Gradually I added the surface sounds of archaeologists digging and brushing away at dust, panning these sounds around the audience, with my frequency clusters (a series of 27 combinations) fading, pulsing in and out, at more and more piercing intensity, until they became audio physical full body immersive sound. Later I heard from the owner of the house, my friend Fabio Malacusa, that the neighbors phoned the police during the concert, to report a UFO landing! probably the best compliment a concert can receive! The police told them to report to a psychiatric ward... Overall, a beautiful audience and experience for us all. I hope to repeat this piece soon and in many places._
