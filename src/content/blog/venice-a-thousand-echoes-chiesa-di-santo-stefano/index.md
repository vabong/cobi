## Venice a Thousand Echoes – Chiesa di Santo Stefano  
*7 April 2024*

As part of the *A Thousand Echoes: Listening to Venice* project, acoustic recordings were made at **15:20 on 8 May 2023**, using **red balloon pops** and a **Sennheiser AMBEO VR microphone** to capture the spatial characteristics of the church.

During May 2023, we recorded **B-format impulse responses** (balloon pops) at a range of iconic Venetian sites, including **Piazza San Marco**, **Rialto Bridge**, **Chiesa di Santo Stefano**, **Chiesa di San Giorgio Maggiore**, **Ex Chiesa dei Santi Cosma e Damiano**, and the **Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute**. Additional recordings were made at **Campo Santo Stefano**, **Campo Santa Margherita**, **Campo San Apollonia**, the **staircase entrance at the Museo Correr**, as well as in a number of narrow alleyways throughout the city.

The recording methodology followed **ISO 3382-1** guidelines as a reference framework. Alongside impulse responses, we also captured **environmental soundscapes**, including daytime and nighttime recordings of **Campo Santa Margherita**, **Campo Santo Stefano**, and **Piazza San Marco**, featuring church bells in counterpoint with human activity, water movement, birds, canals, and boat traffic.

The aim of the project was to explore the **echoes of Venice** by documenting both **acoustic fingerprints** and **lived soundscapes**. This material subsequently informed **two sonic compositions** and the development of a **sonic map**. Our approach is grounded in the humanities, informed by acoustics, and situates sound as both cultural and spatial knowledge.

The recorded spaces are made audible via **Acoustic Atlas**, where they can be experienced directly in the browser. From there, we move into **sonic composition** as a form of practice-led research, reflecting on individual perspectives of **body, time, space, echo, and listening**. Acoustic fingerprints are treated as **spatio-temporal data structures**, and by introducing the listener as an active variable, we examine what is emotionally and perceptually evoked through parameters such as **envelopment, magnitude, intimacy, distance**, material properties of sound and space, **reverberation tail shapes**, **decay times**, and **flutter echoes**.

These questions are addressed through **subjective sonic interventions**, forming the artistic research component of the project.
